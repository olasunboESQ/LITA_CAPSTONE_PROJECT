###Project Overiew

The Project contains two (2) Datasets namely:

- Sales Data
-  Customer Data

In Project 1: Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store
I am tasked with analyzing the sales performance of a retail store. Using the following 
You will need to explore sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional
performance, and monthly sales trends. The goal is to produce an interactive Power BI
dashboard that highlights these findings.
Instructions:
1. Excel:
o Perform an initial exploration of the sales data. Use pivot tables to summarize
total sales by product, region, and month.
o Use Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and
total revenue by region.
o Create any other interesting report
2. SQL:
Hint – You need to load the dataset into your SQL Server environment to write and
validate your queries.
Write queries to extract key insights based on the following questions.
o retrieve the total sales for each product category.
o find the number of sales transactions in each region.
o find the highest-selling product by total sales value.
o calculate total revenue per product.
o calculate monthly sales totals for the current year.
o find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.
o calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.
o identify products with no sales in the last quarter.
3. Power BI:
o Create a dashboard that visualizes the insights found in Excel and SQL. The
dashboard should include a sales overview, top-performing products, and
regional breakdowns.
Project 2: Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service
Summary: This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify
segments and trends. Your goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types,
and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. The final deliverable is a Power BI
dashboard that presents your analysis.
Instructions:
1. Excel:
o Analyze customer data using pivot tables to find subscription patterns.
o Calculate the average subscription duration and identify the most popular
subscription types.
o Create any other interesting reports.
2. SQL:
Hint – You need to load the dataset into your SQL Server environment to write
and validate your queries.
Write queries to extract key insights based on the following questions.
o retrieve the total number of customers from each region.
o find the most popular subscription type by the number of customers.
o find customers who canceled their subscription within 6 months.
o calculate the average subscription duration for all customers.
o find customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months.
o calculate total revenue by subscription type.
o find the top 3 regions by subscription cancellations.
o find the total number of active and canceled subscriptions.
3. Power BI:
o Build a Power BI dashboard that visualizes key customer segments,
cancellations, and subscription trends. Include slicers for interactive analysis
